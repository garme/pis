1.Introduction
==============

Slackware Post-Install Scripts (PIS) are a set of shell scripts for
automating the most tedious Slackware version 15.0 post-install
configuration tasks.

PIS presents a set of command line menus similar to those of the
Slackware installer and aim to simplify and make transparent the main
system settings after a system installation.


2.Features
==========

With PIS v0.2 scripts Slackware users can:

 * Set system locale (language, country and character encoding)
 
 * Configure login mode (GUI or CLI)
 
 * Add new users to system
 
 * Set the 'sudo' admin support
 
 * Set 'Huge' and 'Generic' kernels to boot manager (Elilo)
 
 * Install/Configure different package managers:
    
    - Slackpkg:

        * Set main mirror
        * Install Slackpkg+ extentions
    
    - Sbopkg:

        * Install sbopkg
    
    - Slapt-get:

        * Install slapt-get and extra repositories
        * Install Gslapt (GTK-based GUI for slapt-get)
        * Install slapt-src (slapt-get for Slackbuilds.org)
        * Install slapt-update-notifier


3. Important Notes
==================

To perform the system settings, PIS v0.2 scripts will modify some 
important system files by using command line tools, such as the stream 
editor 'sed', so bypassing the use of the conventional tools.

So, if you want to feel more secure in using the PIS scripts, it would
be interesting to back up the following files, in case you need to
restore manually the respective settings:

 * To set the system locale (language and country):
   
    /etc/profile.d/lang.sh
    /etc/profile.d/lang.csh


 * To set the command line keymap (keyboard character encoding):
 
    /etc/rc.d/rc.keymap

  
 * To select the login mode (GUI or CLI):
 
    /etc/inittab

 
 * To add different kernels types/versions to boot manager Elilo:
 
    /boot/efi/EFI/Slackware/elilo.conf

 
 * To enable the administrative group 'wheel':
 
    /etc/sudoers

 
 * To set the default desktop/window manager for the X environment:
 
    /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc


 * To set the main mirror of the slackpkg package manager:
 
    /etc/slackpkg/mirrors


4.Instalation
=============

To install PIS, you have to: 

 1. Download the PIS Slackware package at
    <https://slackscripts.com/download.html> or by using some download
    manager, as show bellow:


$ wget http://www.slackscripts.com/packages/pis-0.2-noarch-2.txz


 2. Install PIS, running, as root, the command 'installpkg' passing
    the downloaded package name as parameter:


# installpkg pis-0.2-noarch-2.txz


After installing the package, the PIS scripts are ready to be used to
perform the main system settings.


5.Running
=========

To run PIS scripts, as root, you have to run the command:


# pis


It will open the command line main menu of PIS scripts in which the
Slackware users can perform the main system settings.


6. Saving and Loading a Profile File
====================================

A Profile File is a text file which contains the configurations setted
to a system by using the PIS scripts. A Profile File can be used to
automate the main system settings by using PIS, for example, in new
system installations at the same or others machines.


6.1 Savind a Profile File
-------------------------
 
To generate a profile file, before that you must perform the system
settings by using PIS scripts. After that, to register the performed
settings in a Profile File, as root, you can run one of the commands
below:


# pis -o <profile_file_name>


or:


# pis --output <profile_file_name>


With these commmands, it will be created a Profile File with the name
<profile_file_name>. It follows an example of the contents of a Profile
File:


-------------------------------cut-here---------------------------------
language_country=pt_BR.utf8
keyboard_map=br-abnt2.map.gz
login=GUI
kernels=vmlinuz-generic-5.15.19 vmlinuz-generic-5.15.80
wheel_group=YES
user=garme password 0
gui_desktop=xinitrc.xfce
gui_keyboard=br:
slackpkg_mirror=75
slackpkg_slackpkgplus=alienbob restricted
sbopkg=YES
slapt_get_install=YES
slapt_get_extra_repo=slackonly slackers
slapt_get_slapt_src=YES
-------------------------------cut-here---------------------------------


6.2 Loading a Profile File
--------------------------

To load and apply the settings from a Profile File to the system, as
root, you can run one of the following commands:


# pis -f <profile_file_name>


or:


# pis --file <profile_file_name>


With these commmands, the settings from the Profile File named
<profile_file_name> will be loaded and applied to the system.
